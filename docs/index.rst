wilco - Server-Defined React Components
=======================================

**wilco** is a framework that enables Python backends to serve isolated React/TypeScript components.
Components are defined in the Python codebase alongside their TypeScript implementations,
then dynamically bundled with esbuild and loaded by the frontend at runtime.
